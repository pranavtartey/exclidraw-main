# Getting Started

This repo uses the pnpm package manager so make sure you have the pnpm package manager installed.

## Commands

To setup the database in docker run these commands:

### Run postgres container locally

```sh
docker run \-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \-p 5432:5432 \-d postgres
```

### Get the process id

```sh
docker ps
```

### ssh inside the container

```sh
docker exec \-it < process-id >
```

### Now switch to the postgres user

```sh
psql \-U postgres
```

## To run all different services locally

On windows monorepo is a bit tricky to stop. So I suggent not to run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Do this instead

- Go to all the differnet services.
- Try running them saperately on different terminals
- To stop you can just do `ctrl+c`

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Steps

<!-- - `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app -->

- Do a global pnpm install
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
